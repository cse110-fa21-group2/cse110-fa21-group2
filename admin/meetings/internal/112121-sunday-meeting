MVP deadline is coming up.

# Meeting Minutes

## Completed:
1. CSS for expanded recipe page.

## Incomplete:
1. Determining searching/filtering (local vs. another call to api) for query for returning results.
2. Local storage filtering helper functions.
3. Storing recipes (for instance, if by ID, there's the concern that if spponacular database updates, those IDs on their side may change, so the recipes we have would potentially no longer correspond to the same recipe in their database).
4. Navigation bar hamburger style (just need to change placement of search bar).
5. Create recipe page.
